# caridea
Caridea is a miniscule PHP web application library. This shrimpy fellow is what you'd use when you just want some helping hands and not a full-blown framework.

This is its random number generation component. It has providers for Mcrypt and OpenSSL. Other random number generation in PHP isn't considered secure enough to have an adapter here.
